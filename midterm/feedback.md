# Midterm Feedback
The midterm feedback will be very similar to what you receive on a weekly basis for the homework, but more specific for each problem in this case.

## Final Score: 38/50


### Step 1: Priest Score Calculation
* **5pts** - Your code computed the correct probability and returned it
* **5pts** (-5) The format of your docstring resembles ChatGPT, not Professor Boal's examples.

### Step 2: Find a Hospital
* **5pts** - (-1) Your code correctly fetched the correct hospital given the inputs using requests. You need to return None if anything fails.
* **2pts** (-0.5) You had a docstring that described what the function was for; however, you did not include the expected input and output types.
* **3pts** - You had at least three doctests in your docstring

### Step 3: Get the Hospital Address
* **5pts** - Your code correctly fetched the JSON file, parsed it, and looked up the hospital
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for
* **3pts** - You had at least three doctests in your docstring

### Step 4: Process List of Patients
* **10pts** (-4) Your code correctly fetched the psv file, looped through it, and ran your other functions. However, you have two copies of the function here and they are very different. Since the docstring of one resembles ChatGPT, it appears that some of the code may also be from another source.
* **2pts** (-2) The format of your docstring resembles ChatGPT, not Professor Boal's examples.

### Step 5: Compare Results
* **5pts** (-2.5) - Your code looped through all the results and compared them to the provided key; however, parts of your solution did not work and was very messy. Your code produces a result that says the two are not equal.

### Extra Credit
* Up to 15 pts based on correctness and quality of the extra credit step
  * **(+3)** The docstring for your extra credit function resembles ChatGPT, not Professor Boal's examples. Also, your code does not work properly.

### Coding Best Practices:
**3 pts** - Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?
* Docstrings
  * **Your docstrings were very inconsistent.** 
* Good variable names?
  * **Nice job.** 
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
  * **The formatting of your functions is okay, but there are inconsistencies.** 
* Appropriate comments with your code?
  * **Good code comments.** 
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
  * **Your code is easy to follow.**
